### **Recommended Project Sequence**

To ensure an orderly, seamless, and efficient development process, this project should be carried out in the following phases, organized by priority and dependencies:

---

### **Phase 1: Foundation Setup**
This phase establishes the groundwork upon which the rest of the application depends.

#### **1. Fix Database Initialization Issues**
- Resolve any issues with the database setup to ensure a stable environment for implementing the Chart of Accounts and other modules.
- Verify database schema and relationships (e.g., linking transactions to accounts).

#### **2. Implement Chart of Accounts**
- Build the core Chart of Accounts functionality, as it is the foundation for all other features.
  - Define structure and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for accounts.
  - Ensure accounts are categorized and easy to navigate.
- Test the Chart of Accounts module thoroughly to ensure it is stable and operational.

---

### **Phase 2: Core Data Management Features**
Focus on enabling basic data handling and analysis functionality.

#### **3. Develop Data Upload Module**
- Enable users to upload bank statements with the specified columns:
  - Date (YYYYMMDD format)
  - Description
  - Amount
  - Explanation (initially blank)
  - Analysis (dropdown linked to Chart of Accounts, initially blank)
- Add validation for:
  - Correct date formats.
  - Non-empty fields where required.
- Include functionality to delete uploaded files from the system and all associated processes.

#### **4. Build Analyze Data Module**
- Allow users to:
  - Fill in the **Explanation** field to describe transactions.
  - Assign accounts from the Chart of Accounts to the **Analysis** field.
- Implement **basic predictive features** for Analysis:
  - Recommend accounts based on the Explanation field (minimal AI implementation at this stage).
- Test the Analyze Data module to ensure functionality and user-friendliness.

---

### **Phase 3: Reporting and Settings**
Introduce reporting features and settings to provide more utility and configurability.

#### **5. Output and Reporting Module**
- Implement the ability to generate a **Trial Balance** using data from the Analyze module.
- Add functionality to export reports in user-friendly formats (e.g., PDF, Excel).
- Ensure reporting aligns with financial year settings (to be implemented in the next step).

#### **6. Develop Settings Module**
- Add fields for South African company information:
  - Registration Number, Company Name, Address, Tax Number, VAT Number.
- Include functionality for setting the **financial year**:
  - User selects a year-end month (e.g., February).
  - System calculates the financial year start and end dates automatically.
- Ensure all features, including reporting, align with financial year settings.

---

### **Phase 4: Enhancements to Core Functionality**
Refine existing features and improve usability.

#### **7. Refine User Experience**
- Improve the Explanation input field:
  - Ensure content remains visible after typing.
  - Simplify repetitive transaction handling (e.g., applying the same explanation to similar transactions).
- Fix performance bottlenecks:
  - Address slow file loading and request timeouts in the Analyze Data module.
- Enhance error handling and user feedback for suggestion buttons and other features.

#### **8. Implement Advanced Predictive Features**
- Extend predictive capabilities with the following:
  1. **Explanation Recognition Feature (ERF)**:
     - Match transactions based on:
       - 70% text similarity.
       - 95% semantic similarity.
     - Replicate explanations across similar transactions.
  2. **Account Suggestion Feature (ASF)**:
     - Use AI to suggest accounts based on transaction descriptions.
     - Include confidence scoring and reasoning for suggestions.
  3. **Explanation Suggestion Feature (ESF)**:
     - Proactively suggest explanations based on transaction descriptions and past data.
     - Learn from user corrections to improve accuracy.

#### **9. Introduce Non-AI Predictive Features**
- Develop traditional pattern-matching and database-driven predictive features to complement AI capabilities:
  - Direct and fuzzy matches for similar descriptions.
  - Keyword-based rules and user-defined mappings.
  - Historical pattern analysis (e.g., frequent categorizations).

---

### **Phase 5: Final Refinements and Testing**
Ensure stability, performance, and user satisfaction before launch.

#### **10. Comprehensive Testing**
- Conduct end-to-end testing of the entire system, including:
  - Data upload, analysis, reporting, and settings modules.
  - Predictive features (AI and non-AI).
  - Compatibility with financial year configurations.

#### **11. Resolve Outstanding Issues**
- Address any remaining bugs, such as:
  - Suggestion button errors.
  - Broken repetitive transaction recognition.
- Fix server connectivity issues (e.g., OpenAI API rate limits).

#### **12. Optimize Performance**
- Ensure the application runs efficiently:
  - Optimize slow processes (e.g., file loading, analysis).
  - Minimize latency for AI-driven suggestions.

---

### **Phase 6: Deployment and Monitoring**
Roll out the system and ensure smooth operation.

#### **13. Production Deployment**
- Deploy the application to the production environment, ensuring:
  - Separation from development/test environments.
  - User data integrity and migration (if applicable).

#### **14. Monitor and Improve**
- Continuously monitor performance and user feedback.
- Address any new issues that arise post-deployment.
