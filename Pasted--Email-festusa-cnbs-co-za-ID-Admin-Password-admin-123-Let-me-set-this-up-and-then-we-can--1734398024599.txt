Let me set this up and then we can continue with analyzing and incorporating your specimen files.
Recommended Project Sequence
To ensure an orderly, seamless, and efficient development process, this project should be carried out in the following phases, organized by priority and dependencies:
________________________________________
Phase 1: Foundation Setup
This phase establishes the groundwork upon which the rest of the application depends.
1. Fix Database Initialization Issues
•	Resolve any issues with the database setup to ensure a stable environment for implementing the Chart of Accounts and other modules.
•	Verify database schema and relationships (e.g., linking transactions to accounts).
2. Implement Chart of Accounts
•	Build the core Chart of Accounts functionality, as it is the foundation for all other features. 
o	Define structure and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for accounts.
o	Ensure accounts are categorized and easy to navigate.
•	Test the Chart of Accounts module thoroughly to ensure it is stable and operational.
•	I seem to be confused by the menus I am seeing now. Users have a separate set of menus from that of Admin. Users don’t have an admin menu. The admin has a difference set of menus; Dashboard, Active Subscribers, Deactivated Subscribers, Charts of Accounts, Admin Settings. On the dashboard we will have Financial Insights, Expense Forecast, Quick Ratio, Current Ratio and all other indicators you recommend. Under Reports, we will have submenus, Banks Statements, General Ledgers, Trial Balance, Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Income, and Statement of Cash Flow. These will adhere to IFRS. The complete menus are Dashboard, Data Upload, Data Analysis (Formerly Analyze Data, I prefer Data Analysis), Reports (formerly Output, I prefer Reports), Charts of Accounts, and Company Settings. We need to put in place the admin user. the user email is festusa@cnbs.co.za. ID is Admin, and password is admin@123. Before that I want to provide you some specimens, The charts, the bank upload formats, and the Trial Balance should look like. I want all these incorporated in the foundation.  The application is 'Analee". The admin has a different set of menus, Dashboard, Active Subscribers, Deactivated Subscribers, Charts of Accounts, Admin Settings. We upload the charts of Accounts at Charts of Accounts menu of Admin which all users see and access. Once the user registers, it copy and the charts of accounts and when the user edit delete or add charts of accounts, it does not affect the systems charts of accounts, but only the use charts of accounts
•	Now, let’s set up the charts of accounts. We are going to have the ability to upload and the ability to add account one after the other. The Action column is where we delete or edit. Once we have this in place, we will register the first user and see if it appears in the Active Subscribers and if the user automatically have the Charts of Accounts. 
The rules are,
1.	The development environment is separated from the production environment so that the version I have deployed remained protected because users are using it.
2.	All data are protected
3.	The charts of accounts must be protected and not altered.
4.	All features and tasks completed must not be changed unless I specifically request for it.
Please adhere strictly to these rules.

The next step is to register the users. Upon registration, the user automatically has a copy of the charts of accounts from application copy and yet detached from the application copy so that the user can edit, delete or add an account without affecting, or reflecting in, the application charts of accounts.
